1. Add shop configuration to `configs/shops.lua`
2. Set `travel.location = 'guarma'`
3. Configure pricing, NPCs, and blips as needed
4. The destination will automatically appear in Guarma's travel menu

## Tips & Recommendations

Add a respawn point for Guarma in your `vorp_core` config:

Guarma = {
    name = "Guarma",
    pos = vector4(1309.37, -6895.1, 48.85, 57.79)
},
```

### Performance Optimization

### Pricing Strategy

- Use different currencies for varied gameplay (cash/gold/items)
- Set `remove = false` for VIP/membership systems
- Consider travel time when setting prices
